# GameStop Collectibles Dynamic Pricing Engine
## Technical Solution Architecture & Implementation Plan

**Prepared by:** Ish Prasad | Staff AI/ML Engineer
**Date:** April 2026
**For:** Ravi & Team — GameStop AI/ML Engineering

---

## Executive Summary

GameStop's collectibles business (graded trading cards — Pokemon, sports, TCG) currently prices cards using daily batch scrapes from eBay, with no price history storage, no sentiment analysis, and no ML-based pricing. This document presents a complete technical architecture for a **dynamic pricing engine** that combines multi-source market data, social sentiment, ML price prediction with uncertainty quantification, and anomaly detection — all designed to be built in-house with open-source tools.

**The core insight:** Collectibles pricing is a *sparse, irregular, fat-tailed* prediction problem — not a standard time series. Most cards sell infrequently (1-10x per month), prices can 10x overnight on social virality, and the same card at different grades can differ 50x in value. The system must handle this heterogeneity with volume-aware routing, not a one-size-fits-all model.

**GameStop's unique advantage:** Physical store foot traffic + trade-in pricing data that no online competitor (PriceCharting, Alt, Card Ladder) has access to. This is the moat.

## 1. Data Architecture

### 1.1 Data Sources — Priority Ranked

| Priority | Source | Data Type | Access Method | Cost | Update Frequency |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------------|------|-----------------|
| **P0** | eBay Marketplace Insights API | Sold listings (90 days) | Limited Release API — negotiate access | Negotiate | Event-driven (every 15 min) |
| **P0** | SoldComps API | eBay sold listings (365 days) | REST API | $59/mo (5,000 req/mo) | Every 15 min (cron) |
| **P0** | PriceCharting API | Aggregated prices (all time) | REST API (40-char token) | ~$15-30/mo (Legendary tier) | Daily (2 AM cron) |
| **P1** | PSA Population Reports | Grade population counts | Web scrape (psacard.com/pop) or GemRate | Free (GemRate) | Daily (3 AM cron) |
| **P1** | CardHedger API | 40M+ transactions, multi-platform | REST API | $49+/mo | Near real-time |
| **P1** | Reddit (old.reddit.com) | Social sentiment | Browser Rendering scrape (old.reddit.com) | Free (Cloudflare Workers) | Every 5 min (cron) |
| **P2** | Twitter/X API | Event detection, viral moments | Pay-per-use | ~$500-1K/mo | **DEFERRED** |
| **P2** | TCGPlayer API | Pokemon/MTG market prices | Apply for access | Free (with approval) | Daily |
| **P2** | PokemonPriceTracker API | Graded Pokemon prices + pop | REST API | $99/mo (Business) | Daily |
| **P3** | GameStop internal | Trade-in data, foot traffic, inventory | Internal DB | Free | **DEFERRED** — requires integration |

### 1.2 eBay Strategy — Legal & Practical

**Do NOT scrape eBay directly.** eBay explicitly bans AI agents and scraping in their Feb 2026 User Agreement. As a publicly traded company with an eBay business relationship, GameStop cannot afford the legal/business risk.

**Instead:**
1. **Negotiate Marketplace Insights API access** — GameStop's retail footprint gives leverage. This API returns sold items for last 90 days and is the gold standard.
2. **Use SoldComps as fallback** ($59/mo) — licensed eBay sold data via REST API, up to 240 results per request, 365 days history.
3. **Use CardHedger for multi-platform** ($49/mo) — aggregates eBay, Fanatics, Heritage Auctions, and more.

### 1.3 Price History Storage

GameStop doesn't store price history. This is the foundation everything else depends on.

**Built on Cloudflare D1** (SQLite at the edge, zero cold starts, global replication, ~$5-20/mo at moderate scale):

```

```

### 1.4 Data Pipeline Architecture

The entire pipeline runs on **Cloudflare Cron Triggers**, **Cloudflare Queues**, and **Durable Object agents**. There is no Airflow, no separate orchestrator.

**Pipeline ordering is critical** — anomaly detection (4 AM) must run before features/predictions (5-6 AM) so flagged outliers are excluded from downstream computation.

## 2. Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Feature Categories & Importance

Based on research across collectibles pricing systems, academic papers, and production implementations (PriceCharting, Alt, Card Ladder, StockX):

| Rank | Feature Group | Predictive Power | Implementation Complexity |
|------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Grade + Grading Company** | ~25-30% of variance | Low — structured data from PSA/CGC |
| 2 | **Card Identity** (set, number, player/character) | ~20-25% | Medium — learned embeddings |
| 3 | **Recent Sold Prices** (lagged features) | ~15-20% | Low — rolling stats from price history |
| 4 | **Population Report** (supply) | ~8-12% | Medium — daily pop scraping |
| 5 | **Sold Velocity** (demand signal) | ~5-8% | Low — count sales per window |
| 6 | **Macro Market Index** | ~3-5% | Medium — aggregate market health |
| 7 | **Player/Meta Performance** | ~3-5% | High — domain-specific APIs |
| 8 | **Seasonality** | ~2-3% | Low — calendar features |
| 9 | **Social Sentiment** | ~1-3% | High — NLP pipeline required |
| 10 | **Rarity Metrics** | ~2-4% | Medium — print run data |

### 2.2 Critical Feature Details

**Grade & Population Features:**
```python
{
    'grade_numeric': 9.5,                    # 1-10 scale
    'grading_company': 'PSA',                # PSA, BGS, CGC, SGC
    'is_gem_mint': True,                     # grade >= 9.5
    'is_perfect_10': False,
    'pop_at_grade': 47,                      # how many exist at this grade
    'pop_higher': 3,                         # how many graded higher
    'pop_ratio': 0.047,                      # % of total pop at this grade
    'is_pop_1': False,                       # unique at this grade
    'pop_growth_rate_90d': 0.12,             # 12% more graded in last 90 days
    # KEY INSIGHT: PSA 10 with pop 5 is worth dramatically more than pop 500
    # The relationship is highly nonlinear — tree models capture this well
}
```

**Demand Signals:** `sales_count_7d/30d/90d`, `velocity_trend` (7d/30d ratio), `price_momentum` (7d MA / 30d MA).

> **DEFERRED features** (require live listing snapshots): `active_listings_count`, `days_of_inventory`, `sell_through_rate`, `avg_bidders_last_5_auctions`. Need eBay Browse API + listing-snapshot pipeline.

**Sentiment Features (from Reddit pipeline):** `social_mention_count_7d`, `social_mention_trend` (7d/30d ratio), `social_sentiment_score` (-1 to 1), `reddit_post_count_7d`, `influencer_mention_7d`, `search_interest_trend`.

**Seasonality Features:** `is_holiday_season`, `is_tax_refund_season`, `is_summer_lull`, `is_nfl_season`, `days_since_set_release`, cyclical month encoding (`month_sin`, `month_cos`).

**GameStop-Exclusive Features (the moat) — DEFERRED:** `gamestop_trade_in_volume_7d`, `gamestop_store_price`, `gamestop_inventory_count`, `gamestop_days_in_inventory`, `gamestop_regional_demand`. No competitor has this data — requires internal DB integration.

## 3. ML Model Architecture

### 3.1 The Core Problem: Heterogeneous Liquidity

Not all cards are created equal. A base set Charizard PSA 10 sells multiple times per week. A 1987 Topps Barry Bonds PSA 8 sells once every 2 months. The model architecture must adapt to volume.

### 3.2 Volume-Aware Ensemble

### 3.3 Primary Model: LightGBM Quantile Regression

LightGBM is the right primary model because:
- Handles mixed feature types natively (categorical grades, continuous prices)
- Captures nonlinear grade-price relationships (PSA 9 vs 10 can be 5-10x)
- Fast inference (<1ms per card)
- Handles missing features gracefully (many features will be NaN for low-volume cards)
- Interpretable via SHAP values

```python
import lightgbm as lgb

# Train on log(price) — normalizes fat-tailed distribution
params = {
    'objective': 'huber',           # Overridden to 'quantile' in the loop below
    'metric': 'mae',
    'learning_rate': 0.03,
    'num_leaves': 63,
    'min_data_in_leaf': 20,
    'feature_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'lambda_l1': 0.1,
    'lambda_l2': 1.0,
    'verbose': -1,
}

# Quantile models for uncertainty — includes p20/p80 for buy/sell thresholds
quantiles = [0.10, 0.20, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.80, 0.90]
models = {}
for q in quantiles:
    params_q = {**params, 'objective': 'quantile', 'alpha': q}
    models[q] = lgb.train(params_q, train_set, num_boost_round=2000,
                          valid_sets=[val_set],
                          callbacks=[lgb.early_stopping(50)])

# Inference: full price distribution
fair_value = np.exp(models[0.50].predict(X))      # Median = fair market value
buy_threshold = np.exp(models[0.20].predict(X))    # Buy if below this
sell_threshold = np.exp(models[0.80].predict(X))   # Sell if above this
confidence_width = (np.exp(models[0.90].predict(X)) - np.exp(models[0.10].predict(X))) / fair_value
```

**Why Huber loss, not MSE:** A single anomalous $3,000 sale of a card that normally trades at $50 will destroy a model trained with MSE. Huber loss is robust to these fat-tailed outliers.

**Why log(price):** Collectibles prices are log-normally distributed. A $50 card varying +/-$10 is the same relative uncertainty as a $5,000 card varying +/-$1,000.

### 3.4 Conformal Prediction for Calibrated Uncertainty

Quantile regression gives intervals, but they may not be calibrated (the 90% interval might only cover 78% of actuals). Conformal prediction wraps any model to give **distribution-free coverage guarantees** by computing nonconformity scores on a calibration set and using the empirical quantile as the interval width.

### 3.5 Buy/Sell Decision Framework

> **Critical:** Thresholds are based on **net realizable value (NRV)** — what GameStop actually nets after selling — not raw market quantiles.

Economics constants (implemented in `PricingRecommendationAgent`): marketplace fee 13%, shipping $5, return rate 3%, required margin 20%. NRV = `fair_value * (1 - fee) * (1 - return_rate) - shipping`. Max buy price = `NRV * (1 - required_margin)`.

**Note:** Reddit deprecated its Data API in favor of Devvit, so we scrape via Cloudflare's headless Chrome (Browser Rendering) instead of using the API directly. We fetch `old.reddit.com/<subreddit>.json` through Browser Rendering, which returns structured JSON without requiring API credentials.

**Note:** Twitter/X integration is **DEFERRED**. v1 uses Reddit only.

### 4.2 Target Subreddits

| Subreddit | Members | Focus | Est. Daily Volume |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| r/PokemonTCG | ~280K | Pokemon cards | ~500 posts/day |
| r/baseballcards | ~150K | Baseball | ~300 posts/day |
| r/basketballcards | ~60K | Basketball | ~150 posts/day |
| r/footballcards | ~50K | Football | ~120 posts/day |

| r/sportscards | ~30K | General sports | ~80 posts/day |
| r/TradingCardCommunity | ~15K | General TCG | ~50 posts/day |

### 4.3 Viral Event Detection

Social media sentiment's biggest value is **catching viral moments** before they hit prices. The **PriceMonitorAgent** implements this: if social mentions in a 6-hour window exceed 3x the 7-day rolling average, it fires a `viral_social` alert and invalidates the KV price cache for affected cards.

---

## 5. Anomaly Detection

### 5.1 Seller-Side Anomaly Detection

> **Data limitation:** SoldComps, CardHedger, and PriceCharting return sold-listing summaries, not bid-level event data. True shill-bidding detection is not feasible without a bid-history feed.

```
What we CAN detect from sold listings:
├── Seller price inflation — sellers consistently above market (via seller_id if available)
├── Statistical price outliers — IQR-based detection on price vs. historical average
├── Suspicious pricing patterns — high-value graded cards at <$1 (data quality)
└── Price spike/crash detection — 7d vs 30d moving average divergence > 30%

What we CANNOT detect without bid-event data:
├── Same bidder repeatedly losing to same seller
├── Bid increment manipulation
├── Concentrated bidding in final seconds
└── Buyer-seller relationship graphs

Model: Statistical outlier detection + seller concentration (if seller_id available)
Action: Flag price_observations.is_anomaly = true, exclude from training/features
```

Anomaly detection runs daily at **4 AM UTC** (before features at 5 AM, predictions at 6 AM) so flagged outliers are excluded from downstream computation.

### 5.2 Data Quality Issues

- **"Best Offer Accepted" bias:** eBay shows listing price, not accepted price. Biases upward 15-25%. Fix: flag and discount by 20%, or exclude.
- **Lot sales:** Filter via keyword detection (lot, bundle, collection, set of, x2, x3).
- **Currency normalization:** International sales in GBP/EUR/AUD must be converted to USD at the sale date exchange rate.

---

## 6. Backtesting & Evaluation

### 6.1 Walk-Forward Validation

**Never use random train/test splits for time series data.** Always train on past, test on future. Full walk-forward requires 6+ months of raw transaction data. At launch, use PriceCharting backfill with reduced feature set.

### 6.2 Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **MdAPE** (Median Absolute % Error) | <15% high-vol, <25% mid-vol, <40% low-vol |
| **Directional Accuracy** | >60% |
| **Coverage** (90% CI) | 87-93% |
| **Interval Width %** | <30% for high-vol |
| **Simulated Trading P&L** | Positive over backtest |

**Critical:** Report metrics **stratified by volume bucket.**

### 7.1.1 Security & Authentication

Implemented:
- **SignIn gate:** Dashboard requires an access code entry on a SignIn page. The code is server-validated against the `DEMO_ACCESS_CODE` secret.
- **Session tokens:** `POST /v1/auth/login` accepts `{ code }` and returns an HMAC-signed session token with 24-hour expiry, stored in KV.
- **Auth middleware:** All `/v1/*` routes accept either a static API key (`X-API-Key` header) OR a session token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). Bypassed in development environment.
- **Session management:** `POST /v1/auth/verify` checks token validity and returns `{ valid, expiresAt }`. `POST /v1/auth/logout` invalidates the session token in KV.
- **Agent auth:** All `/agents/*` routes also gated by the same auth middleware in non-development environments.
- **CORS:** Locked to allowed origins, configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.
- **Rate limiting:** KV-based throttling at 120 requests/min per token on `/v1/*`.
- **Secrets management:** All API keys stored via `wrangler secret put` — `SOLDCOMPS_API_KEY`, `PRICECHARTING_API_KEY`, `CARDHEDGER_API_KEY`, `POKEMON_PRICE_TRACKER_KEY`, `API_KEY`, `DEMO_ACCESS_CODE`, `SESSION_SECRET`.
- **D1 access:** Restricted to Workers bindings only — no public database endpoint.

Required before production:
- **GameStop SSO:** Dashboard should require GameStop SSO for production.
- **Data privacy:** `seller_id` should be hashed before storage.

### 7.1.2 Custom Domains & Deployment

- **API:** `api.gmestart.com` — Cloudflare Worker (Hono)
- **Dashboard:** `app.gmestart.com` — Cloudflare Pages (Vite + React)
- **SignIn gate:** Dashboard requires access code `GMESTART2026` before granting a session token. The code is validated server-side via `POST /v1/auth/login`.

### 7.2 API Endpoints

All endpoints are under `/v1/` and require API key or session token authentication (except the root health check and auth endpoints).

**Auth:**
```
POST /v1/auth/login               — { code } → { token, expiresAt }
POST /v1/auth/verify              — → { valid, expiresAt }

```

Agents are also accessible via WebSocket using the Agents SDK `useAgent()` hook from the dashboard.

### 7.3 Autonomous Agents (Durable Objects)

Four Durable Object agents run autonomously alongside the cron pipeline. Each uses the Cloudflare Agents SDK with hibernation, automatic retry, and real-time state sync via WebSocket.

#### 7.3.1 PriceMonitorAgent

**Purpose:** Detects price anomalies and viral social events in real time, triggers cache invalidation for affected cards.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Schedule | `scheduleEvery(900)` — every 15 minutes |
| Hibernate | Yes |
| Retry | 3 attempts, 1-30s backoff |
| Max alerts | 100 (validated on state change) |

**State:** `lastCheckAt`, `activeAlerts[]`, `checksRun`, `anomaliesDetected`

**Callable methods:**
- `runMonitoringCheck()` — Queries D1 for 30% 1d-vs-30d price divergence + viral social mentions (>3x 7d average in 6h). Writes `price_alerts` rows. Invalidates KV cache for affected cards.
- `getStatus()` — Returns last check time, alert counts, recent alerts.
- `clearAlerts()` — Clears active alerts.
- `listSchedules()` / `cancelTask(id)` — Schedule management.

#### 7.3.2 MarketIntelligenceAgent

**Purpose:** Generates daily AI-powered market briefings using Workers AI (Gemma 4 26B).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Schedule | `schedule("0 7 * * *")` — daily at 7 AM |
| Hibernate | Yes |
| Retry | 2 attempts, 5-60s backoff |
| Reports stored | Last 30 |

**State:** `reports[]`, `lastGeneratedAt`, `totalReports`

**Callable methods:**
- `generateDailyReport()` — Queries D1 for top gainers/decliners (7d), active alerts, sentiment summary, volume stats. Sends to Gemma 4 26B for prose summary. Returns `MarketReport` with highlights, top movers, and market sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral).
- `getLatestReport()` — Most recent report.
- `getReportHistory(count)` — Last N reports (default 7).
- `getStatus()` — Generation stats.

#### 7.3.3 CompetitorTrackerAgent

**Purpose:** Scans for price gaps between GameStop's fair value and competitor prices (PriceCharting, CardHedger, SoldComps).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Schedule | `scheduleEvery(21600)` — every 6 hours |
| Hibernate | Yes |
| Retry | 3 attempts, 2-30s backoff |
| Max gaps tracked | 50 |

**State:** `lastScanAt`, `priceGaps[]`, `scansCompleted`, `opportunitiesFound`

**Callable methods:**
- `scanCompetitorPrices()` — Compares top 100 cards' `model_predictions.fair_value` against recent `price_observations` from external sources. Flags gaps >15%. Matches on grade+grading_company to avoid false gaps.
- `getOverpriced(limit)` / `getUnderpriced(limit)` — Filtered gap lists.
- `getAllGaps()` — All gaps sorted by magnitude.
- `getStatus()` — Scan stats with overpriced/underpriced counts.

#### 7.3.4 PricingRecommendationAgent

**Purpose:** Generates actionable BUY/SELL/REPRICE recommendations with human-in-the-loop approval workflow.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Schedule | `schedule("0 8 * * *")` — daily at 8 AM (recommendations) |
|          | `scheduleEvery(21600)` — every 6h (expire stale) |
| Hibernate | Yes |
| Retry | 2 attempts, 5-60s backoff |
| Max pending | 200 (validated on state change) |

**State:** `pending[]`, `history[]`, `lastGeneratedAt`, `stats` (totalGenerated/Approved/Rejected/Expired)

**Economics constants:** `MARKETPLACE_FEE = 13%`, `SHIPPING_COST = $5`, `RETURN_RATE = 3%`, `REQUIRED_MARGIN = 20%`

**Callable methods:**
- `generateRecommendations()` — For all HIGH/MEDIUM confidence predictions with fair_value > $10: computes NRV, generates BUY (market < max buy price), SELL (market > sell threshold), or REPRICE (near breakeven). Top 50 by margin, sorted.
- `approveRecommendation(id, approvedBy)` — Moves to history as approved.
- `rejectRecommendation(id, rejectedBy)` — Moves to history as rejected.
- `getPending(action?)` — Filter pending by action type.
- `getHistory(limit)` — Approval/rejection history.
- `getStatus()` — Pending counts by action, stats.
- `expireStaleRecommendations()` — Auto-expires pending recs older than 48 hours.

## 9. Competitive Landscape

| | PriceCharting | Card Ladder (PSA) | Alt | **GameStop (v1 Shipped)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Data sources** | eBay + own marketplace | 14 platforms | Multiple | SoldComps + PriceCharting + PSA pop + Reddit |
| **ML pricing** | Algorithmic smoothing (no ML) | Unknown | Likely gradient boosting | LightGBM quantile regression (batch) + statistical fallback |
| **Sentiment** | None | None | Unknown | Reddit NLP (Workers AI) |
| **Update frequency** | Daily | Near real-time | Near real-time | Hybrid: 15-min ingestion + daily model + 15-min agent monitoring |
| **Uncertainty** | None | None | None | Conformal prediction intervals (p10-p90) |
| **Physical retail data** | No | No | No | **DEFERRED** — requires internal integration |
| **Anomaly detection** | Manual review | Unknown | Unknown | Automated (IQR outliers, data quality, viral detection) |
| **Autonomous agents** | No | No | No | 4 agents (monitor, intelligence, competitors, recommendations) |
| **Buy/sell decisions** | No | No | Unknown | NRV-based with margin targets + human approval workflow |

**Honest assessment:** v1 does not yet have GameStop's "unfair advantage" (internal store data). The moat exists but is not yet plumbed. What ships is a best-in-class ML pricing engine with uncertainty quantification and autonomous monitoring — competitive with or ahead of Alt/Card Ladder on technical sophistication, behind on data breadth until internal data is connected.

## 10. Cost Estimate (Cloudflare Stack)

### Monthly Operating Costs

| Item | Cost/Month | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Cloudflare Workers Paid plan | $5 | Includes 10M requests/mo |
| Cloudflare D1 | ~$5-15 | Based on rows read/written |
| Cloudflare KV | ~$5-10 | Price cache + rate limiting |
| Cloudflare R2 | ~$5-10 | Model artifacts, data archive (no egress fees) |
| Cloudflare Queues | ~$1-5 | Two queues, moderate volume |
| Cloudflare Workers AI | ~$10-50 | Gemma 4 26B for reports + DistilBERT for sentiment |
| Durable Objects (4 agents) | ~$5-15 | Billed per request + storage |
| SoldComps API (Scale) | $59 | Primary market data |
| CardHedger API | $49 | Multi-platform data |
| PriceCharting (Legendary) | ~$25 | Historical/aggregated prices |
| PokemonPriceTracker (Business) | $99 | Graded Pokemon data |
| Cloudflare Browser Rendering | ~$5-10 | Reddit scraping via headless Chrome |
| GitHub Actions (retraining) | ~$0-10 | Free tier usually sufficient |
| MLflow (local) | $0 | Self-hosted |
| **Total** | **~$280-$360/month** |

**Deferred costs (not in v1):**
- Twitter/X API: ~$500-1K/mo
- ML training compute (if moved to cloud): ~$20-50/mo
- GameStop internal data pipeline: $0 (internal infra)

**vs. Palantir/vendor alternative:** $100K-500K+/year for a fraction of the functionality.

## 11. Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| eBay API access denied | High | SoldComps + CardHedger as fallbacks; negotiate via GameStop's retail partnership |
| Model accuracy insufficient for low-volume cards | Medium | Volume-aware routing, wide uncertainty bands, human review for <10 sales/quarter |
| Social sentiment is noisy/manipulable | Low | Weight sentiment low (1-3% of signal), use as regime detector not price predictor |
| Price history cold start | Medium | Backfill from PriceCharting CSV, SoldComps 365-day lookback |
| Fat-tailed prices break the model | Medium | Huber loss, log-transform, quantile regression, IQR outlier detection |
| eBay "Best Offer" bias (+15-25%) | Medium | Detect and discount by 20%, or exclude from training |
| Reddit scraping reliability | Low | Browser Rendering may break if old.reddit.com changes format; fallback to direct .json endpoint or Devvit app |
| **D1 10GB database limit** | Medium | Archive old price_observations to R2 at ~6 months; keep only recent windows in D1 |
| **Worker CPU time limits (30s)** | Medium | Batch D1 writes at 90 statements; chunk large operations; use Queues for async |
| **KV eventual consistency** | Low | 5-minute TTL on price cache; evaluate endpoint reads D1 directly |
| **Worker 128MB memory limit** | Low | Batch predictions loaded from R2 JSON; paginate for >100K cards |
| **Durable Object single-point-of-failure** | Low | Agents use hibernation + retry with backoff; state persists across restarts |
| **R2 model artifact corruption** | Medium | Versioned predictions in `models/versions/`; full rollback system implemented |
| **Cron trigger overlap** | Low | Pipeline is ordered with 1-hour gaps; each stage is idempotent |
| **CORS currently open (`*`)** | High | Must lock to GameStop domains before production |
