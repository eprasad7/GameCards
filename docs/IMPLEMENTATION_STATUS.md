# Implementation Status

Last updated: 2026-04-14

## Summary

The core data pipeline (ingestion, anomaly detection, feature computation, prediction, and serving) is implemented for the prototype. The Python ML pipeline now includes training, backtesting, conformal evaluation, ONNX export, and batch scoring to R2. Runtime serving uses **batch predictions from R2 with statistical fallback**, while the dashboard is functional but still prototype-grade.

## Status Key

- **Implemented** — code complete, wired into the system, ready for production testing
- **Partially implemented** — core logic exists but has gaps or untested paths
- **Stubbed** — function signatures and data flow exist, body is placeholder or TODO
- **Not started** — mentioned in spec but no code exists

## Security (Spec Section 7.1.1)

All items below are listed as **required before production deployment** in the updated spec.

| Requirement                         | Status      | Notes |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------|
| API key authentication              | Implemented | `X-API-Key` header on all `/v1/*` routes. Skipped when `ENVIRONMENT=development`. New `API_KEY` secret. |
| Rate limiting                       | Implemented | KV-based sliding window, 120 req/min per key. Returns `429` with `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header. |
| GameStop SSO for dashboard          | Not started | |
| CORS lockdown to GameStop domains   | Not started | Currently `cors("*")` in `src/index.ts` |
| `seller_id` hashing before storage  | Not started | Currently stored as plaintext from SoldComps |
| Secrets management                  | Implemented | All API keys configured via `wrangler secret put` |
| D1 access restriction               | Implemented | Only accessible via Worker bindings, no public endpoint |

---

## Biggest Gaps

1. **CORS lockdown and remaining security.** API key auth and rate limiting are implemented, but CORS is still `cors("*")`, `seller_id` is stored as plaintext, and GameStop SSO for the dashboard is not started.

2. **Operationalizing the batch-scoring path.** The full pipeline (export → train → score → upload) works via `run_pipeline.sh` but is manual. Production needs a scheduled job (CI cron, Modal, or Railway) and an artifact promotion/rollback flow.

3. **Conformal correction handoff.** Conformal calibration runs during evaluation, but the correction factor is not automatically persisted from training into `batch_score.py` for production scoring.

4. **Historical price backfill.** The card catalog can now be bootstrapped via `POST /v1/system/bootstrap` (reads PriceCharting CSV from R2). However, `price_observations` still needs historical backfill from SoldComps or PriceCharting exports.

5. **D1 data archival.** The spec notes the 10GB D1 limit and calls for archiving old observations to R2 (Parquet/CSV) at approximately the 6-month mark. No archival logic exists.

6. **Source-specific dedup/data contracts.** The prototype deduplicates by `listing_url` and `post_url`, but production needs per-source rules so sold listings, aggregated daily prices, and sentiment events are not conflated.

7. **Agent testing and validation.** The 4 Durable Object agents are implemented but have no tests and limited validation against production data patterns. The PriceMonitorAgent overlaps with the existing cron-based anomaly detection — the relationship between them (complementary or replacement) should be clarified.

## Spec vs. Code Discrepancy: Cron Schedule Order

The updated spec and the code now match on daily job order:

1. anomaly detection (`0 4 * * *`)
2. aggregates + features (`0 5 * * *`)
3. predictions (`0 6 * * *`)

This keeps anomalous observations out of downstream features and predictions.
